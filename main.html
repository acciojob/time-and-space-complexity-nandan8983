		Informatio about Time and Space Complexity
	</h1>
	<p>
		Time complexity measures an algorithm's performance and shows how processing time changes as input size increases. and its efficient to calculate.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b> evaluates memory use, ensuring the algorithm uses O(n) space efficiently relative to input size.
